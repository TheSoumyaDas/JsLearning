}

// can this will work in array
const programmingLanguages = ["js", "cpp", "swift", "jsx"]; // arrays has keys starts form 0 to infinity

for (const key in programmingLanguages) {
  console.log(programmingLanguages[key]); // so while doing key it gives us key value of array that starts from 0 but while consoling like this way it will give you value
}

// for itrating on map is not possible for "forin loop"
// learn about forIn loop
